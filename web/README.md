Audally is an open source project. We collect all our frontend code in this repository and give everyone the chance to see the code and contribute to it. Audally-Web contains a lot of code, design mockups and more.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
